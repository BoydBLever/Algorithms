            # Base case 
            if root is None:

            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                return root.val == targetSum
            # Recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees

    # Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree
    # Space complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree
    # Example 1: Binary Tree
    #          5
    #        /   \
    #       4     8
    #      /     / \
    #     11    13  4
    #    /  \        \
    #   7    2        1
    # targetSum = 22
    # Output: True because 5->4->11->2 sums to 22
    # Here's how the recursive calls in the algorithm would process this:
    # 1. First Call: hasPathSum(root=5, targetSum=22)
